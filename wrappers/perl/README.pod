=head1 NAME

Xray::FeffPath - SWIG-based interface to libfeffpath

=head1 VERSION

1.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This provides a simple object oriented interface to the C<feffpath>
wrapper around Feff's C<onepath> subroutine.  C<onepath> combines the
F-matrix calculation in F<GENFMT/genfmt.f> with the construction of the
common presentation of F-effective from F<FF2X/feffdt.f>.

Given the geometry of a scattering path in the form of Cartesian
coordinates of atoms making up the path, along with some additional
information such as the degeneracy, compute F-effective for that
scattering path.

This replaces the need to read a F<feffNNNN.dat> file.  Given a
scattering geometry, the equivalent data can be computed directly.

The following computes the columns of the F<feff0004.dat> file for
copper metal:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Xray::FeffPath;

  my $path = Xray::FeffPath->new();
  $path->degen(48);
  $path->Index(4);
  $path->phpad('../fortran/phase.pad');
  $path->atom(0, 0, -3.61, 1);
  $path->atom(-1.805, 0, -1.805, 1);
  $path->path;
  my @kgrid  = @{ $path->k };
  my @caps   = @{ $path->real_phc };
  my @amff   = @{ $path->mag_feff };
  my @phff   = @{ $path->pha_feff };
  my @redfac = @{ $path->red_fact };
  my @lambda = @{ $path->lam };
  my @rep    = @{ $path->rep };
  undef $path

=head1 INSTALLATION

After you have built and installed I<feff85exafs>, do the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install

That's it!  Note, though, that building this wrapper B<requires> that
the fortran and C code I<feff85exafs> be completely compiled and thet
the resulting libraries (and other files) be successfully installed.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new>

Create the FeffPath object

   my $path = Xray::FeffPath->new();

=item C<atom>

Add an atom to the scattering path, supplying the Cartesian
coordiantes of the atom and its unique potential index.

   $nleg = $path->atom($x, $y, $z, $ipot);

This returns the current number of legs in the path.  To make a SS
paths do:

   $path->atom($x,  $y,  $z, $ipot1);
   print $path->nleg, $/;
   #   ==prints===> 2

To make a MS paths do:

   $path->atom($x1, $y1, $z1, $ipot1);
   $path->atom($x2, $y2, $z2, $ipot2);
   $path->atom($x3, $y3, $z3, $ipot3);
   print $path->nleg, $/;
   #   ==prints===> 4

Note that there is no setter method for the nleg attribute.  Rather,
C<nleg> is incremented by each call to the C<atom> method.

=item C<path>

Compute the scattering path

   $path->path;

=item C<clear>

Reinitialize the scattering path

   $path->clear;

=item C<clear>

Destroy the scattering path, freeing the memory used by the library

   $path->clean;

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Each of the members of the FEFFPATH struct is wrapped in a getter
method of the same name.  Each of the following exists:

=head2 Scalar valued attributes

=over 4

=item C<phpad> (character, default = phase.pad)

The path to the F<phase.pad> file.  This gets right-padded with spaces
to 256 characters, which is the length of the parameter in the
underlying Fortran library.  Therefore, the value returned by the
getter will be right-padded.

=item C<Index> (integer, default = 9999)

The path index, used for form the name of the output F<feffNNNN.dat>
file.

Accessing this and other scalar-values attributes works in the typical
Moose-y way:

   $path->Index(4);
   print $path->Index, $/;
   ## ==prints==> 4

Note that this attribute (but only this one) is capitalized to avoid
confusion with the built-in C<index> function.

=item C<degen> (float, default = 0)

The path degeneracy.  This is required input for a calculation.

=item C<nleg> (integer, default = 0)

The number of legs in the path.  This should never be set by hand.  It
gets incremented by calls to the C<atom> method.

=item C<iorder> (integer, default = 2)

Order of approximation for multiple scattering paths.

=item C<nnnn> (boolean, default = 0)

Flag for writing F<feffNNNN.dat> file.

=item C<json> (boolean, default = 0)

Flag for writing F<feffNNNN.json> file.

=item C<verbose> (integer, default = 0)

Flag for writing screen messages as files are written.

=item C<ipol> (boolean, default = 0)

Perform polarization calculation.  This gets toggled to true whenever
any of C<elpty>, C<evec>, or C<xivec> are set.

=item C<elpty> (integer, default = 0)

Ellipticity for use in polarization calculation.

=item C<reff> (float, default = 0)

Half path length.  This should never be set by hand.  It
gets set correctly when the C<path> method is called.

=item C<ne> (integer, default = 0)

Number of outpit k grid point.  This should never be set by hand.  It
gets set correctly when the C<path> method is called.

=back

=head2 Error reporting

=over 4

=item C<errorcode> (integer)

An integer error code from either C<atom> or C<path>.  Check for
non-zero value.  For a non-zero return from C<atom>, calling C<path>
is likely to cause a problem in the genfmt calculation.  For a
non-zero return from C<path>, the genfmt calculation was skipped.  See
C<errormessage> for an explanation of the problem.

=item C<errormessage> (string)

A explanation of words of the problem found during C<atom> or C<path>.

   $path->degen(-48);
   $path->atom(0, 0, 3.61, 1);
   $path->path;
   if ($path->errorcode) {
      print $path->errormessage;
   };
   ## ==prints==>
    Error in make_path
        path degeneracy (-48.00) is negative

=back

=head2 Attributes related to the potential model

Several parameters are captured by the C struct (and therefore
available via the perl wrapper) which are related to how Feff's
potential model was calculated.

=over 4

=item  C<version> 

A string identifying the version number and the `feffpath` wrapper
revision.

=item  C<exch>

A string identifying the type of potential model used.  The
possibilities are

  H-L exch (the default)
  D-H exch
  Gd state
  DH - HL
  DH + HL
  val=s+d
  sigmd(r)
  sigmd=c

See the description of the EXCHANGE keyword in the Feff document
L<http://feffproject.org/feff/Docs/feff9/feff90/feff90_users_guide.pdf>
at page 92.

=item  C<edge>

A poor estimate of the energy threshold relative to the atomic value, in eV.

=item  C<gam_ch>

The core-hole lifetime, in eV.

=item  C<kf>

=item  C<mu>

The Fermi energy, in eV.

=item  C<rnorman>

The average Norman radius.

=item  C<rs_int>

An estimate of the interstitial radius.

=item  C<vint>

The interstitial potential, in eV.

=back

=head2 Array reference valued attributes

=over 4

=item C<ipot>

A list of the unique potentials of the scatterers in a path.  This is
populated by the calls to the C<atom> method.

=item C<rat>

A list of lists of the Cartesian coordinates of the scatterers in a
path.  This is populated by the calls to the C<atom> method.

=item C<evec>

The electric vector of the incident beam for the polarization
calculation.  Note that the setter's argument is an array reference as
is the getter's return value.

    $path->evec([0,0,1]);
    $evec_ref = $path->evec;
    print join(", ", @$evec_ref);
    ## ==prints==> 0, 0, 1

Setting C<evec> will also set C<ipol> to true.

=item C<xivec>

The Poynting vector of the incident beam for the ellipticity
calculation.  Note that the setter's argument is an array reference as
is the getter's return value.

    $path->xivec([1,1,0]);
    $xivec_ref = $path->xivec;
    print join(", ", @$xivec_ref);
    ## ==prints==> 1, 1, 0

Setting C<xivec> will also set C<ipol> to true.

=item C<ri>

The leg lengths (in Angstroms) of the specified path.  This gets set
when C<path> is called.  It returns an reference to an array with
C<nleg> elements.

=item C<beta>

The Eulerian beta angles (in degrees) of the specified path.  This
gets set when C<path> is called.  It returns a reference to an array
with C<nleg> elements.

set when C<path> is called.  It returns a reference to an array with
C<nleg> elements.

A reference to an array containing the magnitude of F-effective.  This
is column 3 from F<feffNNNN.dat>.

=item C<pha_feff>

A reference to an array containing the phase of F-effective.  This is
column 4 from F<feffNNNN.dat>.

=item C<red_fact>

A reference to an array containing the reduction factor.  This is
column 5 from F<feffNNNN.dat>.

=item C<lam>

A reference to an array containing lambda, the mean free path.  This is
column 6 from F<feffNNNN.dat>.

=item C<rep>

A reference to an array containing the real part of the complex
momentum.  This is column 7 from F<feffNNNN.dat>.

=back

=head1 Error codes

The error codes returned by the C<atom> and C<path> methods are the
sums of the codes actually found by the method call, thus the returned
error codes are meant to be interpreted bitwise.

=head2 C<atom> method

If any of these are triggered, it is very likely that a call to
C<path> will return unreliable results or may crash the program.

=over 4

=item I<1>

ipot argument to add_scatterer is less than 0

=item I<2>

ipot argument to add_scatterer is greater than 7

=item I<4>

coordinates are for an atom too close to the previous atom in the path

=item I<8>
